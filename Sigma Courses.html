	<H2> How does one become a Sigma? </h2>
	<p> After all of this talk of what a sigma is, you might wonder, how does one become a sigma? </P>
	<ul>
	<li> <b> Follow your own rules and be yourself </b> <br> Being a sigma is all about not caring what others think about you, so play by your own rules. You shouldn't care about what others think
	<li> <b> Be able to say "I don't know" </b> <br> Many alphas will claim that they know everything, but, as a sigma, you have to be ok with saying you are willing to learn"
	<li> <b> Become independent </b> <br> Get out of your mother's basement, get a job, and become self sufficent. Ok, that was a little harsh ðŸ˜‚, but you get the message. To be a sigma male, you cannot rely on others for everything. You are still allowed to ask for help, but you cannot depend on help from others. <html>
	<li> <b> Listen to Weezer </b> <br> If you don't listen to Weezer, you are simply not a sigma	
	<li> <b> Take our Sigma Course! </b> Who better to teach you to become a sigma than someone who knows all about sigmas? <b> <a href="Sigma Courses.html">Sigma Courses</a> </b>
